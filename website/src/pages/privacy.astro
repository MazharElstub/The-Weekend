    <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain account and planner data while your account remains active.
      When you permanently delete your account in-app, account data is removed in line with product deletion behavior.

      Some limited records may be retained when required for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance.

    <h2>5. Account deletion and your choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can permanently delete your account directly in the iOS app at
      <strong>Settings -> Account -> Delete account</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you own shared calendars, the app provides ownership-transfer or deletion options before final confirmation.
